# Introduction

Proof theory is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with the study of formal proofs. It focuses on the nature of mathematical proofs, including their structure, properties, and limitations. One of the most important concepts in proof theory is the concept of *cut elimination*.

The *cut* rule is a basic rule in formal logic that introduces a new assumption into a proof by assuming both the assumption and its negation, and deriving a contradiction. Cut elimination, also known as the *cut-elimination theorem*, states that any proof that uses the cut rule can be transformed into a proof that does not use the cut rule.

# Statement of the Theorem

The LEAN theorem states:

*The cut rule is admissible in proof theory.*

In other words, any proof that uses the cut rule can be transformed into a proof that does not use the cut rule.

# Proof Sketch

The proof of the LEAN theorem involves showing that for any proof that uses the cut rule, there is an equivalent proof that does not use the cut rule. To do this, we need to define a sequence of transformations that eliminate cuts from a proof.

The key idea behind the proof is to use the properties of the logical connectives and the rules of inference to rewrite the proof in a way that eliminates the need for the cut rule. This involves a systematic process of analyzing each step of the proof and applying the appropriate transformations.

The general strategy for cut elimination is as follows:

1. Identify the cut rule in the proof and its corresponding formula, called the *cut formula*.
2. Find a proof or a set of proofs that do not use the cut rule but can prove the same formula as the cut formula.
3. Replace the cut rule with the proof(s) from step 2, effectively eliminating the cut rule from the original proof.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until there are no more cut rules in the proof.

The key to the success of the cut elimination process is the careful analysis and manipulation of the formulas and the application of the appropriate rules of inference. This requires a deep understanding of the logical connectives, their properties, and their interactions.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the LEAN theorem states that the cut rule is admissible in proof theory. The proof of the theorem involves a systematic process of cut elimination, which transforms any proof that uses the cut rule into a proof that does not use the cut rule. This result is fundamental to the study of proof theory and has important implications for the understanding of mathematical proofs.
